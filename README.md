## **Introduction**
The [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) is a collection of information about three distinct species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The Iris data set that contains a set of 150 features measured from each sample: the lengths and widths of both sepals and petals measured in centimeters.

It was introduced and made famous by the British statistcian and biologist [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) as an example of [Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis). LDA is a technique used in statistics that looks at the differences between the species of flowers and helps to find a straight line or plane that best seperates groups of data. This can be useful to predict the species of a new iris flower based on its measurements i.e. where in the plane it falls. Another valuable resource is its ability to deal with the analysis of multiple variables at the same time and their relationships with each other. 

## Variables
    - Summary of each variable
    - Histogram of each variable
    - Scatter plot of each variable
    – Any other analysis appropriate

# Conclusion
Overall the Iris data set is a bunch of numbers that describe the Iris flowers features, like how big their petals and sepals are. It's a classic dataset used to teach people how to work with data and train machine learning models to recognize patterns and statistics. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) helps to separate different species of iris flowers based on their measurements and simplifies the classification process by combining the measurements into a smaller set of variables.
